JS React Coding Test Assignment

This project is to display some random user data on a page using react, to include a filter and some basic navigation

Spec:
 On page load get json data via api call to https://randomuser.me/api/results=10. This returns random data for 10 fictional users.

 Add a text input box at the top to allow for filter by last name (initially blank). If the last name contains any part of the filter value, it should be included in the information below.

 Create 10 buttons in a row, each to display the data for one of the fictional users. These buttons should be arranged in order of last name.

 When you click on a button it must display the data for that user as components. For each user include at least the name, email address and thumbnail.

 For each user also keep count of how many times the user has been viewed, and display that as well.

 Your solution must be production grade. I am interested in the code part only, not the presentation, so default html/css is expected.

Your page should look something like this:
Filter: _____________
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]
Name: blah blah
Email address: bla@blah.com
[thumbnail image here]
view count: 3
with the data changing as you click on buttons 1-10 and when you change the filter.
